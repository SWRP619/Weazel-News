# Weazel News OBS Banner
This is a free-to-use HTML/javascript based overlay for roleplay streamers.  Basically it puts a banner with scrolling text for breaking news at the bottom of your obs video or stream.  I've included a logo, and the html file.  The html file has the css, html, and javascript all in one file for ease of editing.  Go to line 33 to edit the title section, and line 36 to post your stories.


# How to use:

1) create a directory for the script to reside

2) put files (including this one) into that directory

3) open bottom-text-scroll.html, go to line 33 and line 36 to change it to what you want it to say..

4) load into OBS (or other software) as a "BROWSER SOURCE" the file with the .html extension

5) activate the layer and profit!

4) copy the link and paste it on line 30 in between the “ “ where    SRC="https://i.imgur.com/cOcoLsd.png"

5) Save the file and enjoy!
